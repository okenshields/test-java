## Inventory Physical Count

Represents the quantity of an item variation that is physically present
at a specific location, verified by a seller or a seller's employee. For example,
a physical count might come from an employee counting the item variations on
hand or from syncing with an external system.

### Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description | Getter |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Id` | `String` | Optional | A unique ID generated by Square for the<br>[InventoryPhysicalCount](#type-inventoryphysicalcount). | String getId() |
| `ReferenceId` | `String` | Optional | An optional ID provided by the application to tie the<br>[InventoryPhysicalCount](#type-inventoryphysicalcount) to an external<br>system. | String getReferenceId() |
| `CatalogObjectId` | `String` | Optional | The Square generated ID of the<br>`CatalogObject` being tracked. | String getCatalogObjectId() |
| `CatalogObjectType` | `String` | Optional | The `CatalogObjectType` of the<br>`CatalogObject` being tracked. Tracking is only<br>supported for the `ITEM_VARIATION` type. | String getCatalogObjectType() |
| `State` | [`String`](/doc/models/inventory-state.md) | Optional | Indicates the state of a tracked item quantity in the lifecycle of goods. | String getState() |
| `LocationId` | `String` | Optional | The Square ID of the [Location](#type-location) where the related<br>quantity of items are being tracked. | String getLocationId() |
| `Quantity` | `String` | Optional | The number of items affected by the physical count as a decimal string.<br>Can support up to 5 digits after the decimal point. | String getQuantity() |
| `Source` | [`SourceApplication`](/doc/models/source-application.md) | Optional | Provides information about the application used to generate a change. | SourceApplication getSource() |
| `EmployeeId` | `String` | Optional | The Square ID of the [Employee](#type-employee) responsible for the<br>physical count. | String getEmployeeId() |
| `OccurredAt` | `String` | Optional | A client-generated timestamp in RFC 3339 format that indicates when<br>the physical count took place. For write actions, the `occurred_at`<br>timestamp cannot be older than 24 hours or in the future relative to the<br>time of the request. | String getOccurredAt() |
| `CreatedAt` | `String` | Optional | A read-only timestamp in RFC 3339 format that indicates when Square<br>received the physical count. | String getCreatedAt() |
